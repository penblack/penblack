### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m Pen — just a pen, tryin' to leave its mark on the world. <img src="https://github.com/penblack/penblack/blob/main/pen.gif" width="25" alt="pen"/>

I'm a self-taught frontend designer and security engineer based in America.

I love turning ideas into reality, making accessible cyber defenses that feel effortless. I'm currently building a defensive security suite: [**RedShrew**](RedShrew.com)

Outside of coding and hacking, you’ll find me smoking meats, off-roading, or drawing. I also enjoy writing blog posts and sharing tech-related content on social media.

#### Fun Facts:

* I prefer tea over coffee.!

* Futurama is my favorite show.
